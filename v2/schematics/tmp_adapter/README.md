# ct-Bot v2 adapter boards
These two little adapter boards (for *DRV8835 motor driver* and *teensy 3.5/3.6 development board*) are ***prototypes*** just for ***development and testing***. They are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

## Teensy adapter
The teensy adapter board allows for usage of a Teensy 3.5 (https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy35.html) or Teensy 3.6 development board (https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html) with the original (v1) ct-Bot mainboard. The adapter replaces the ATmega1284P (*IC1*) and has to be plugged into its socket. More information about the pin assignment has to be read out of the schematic.

## Motor driver adapter
The motor driver adapter board allows for usage of the DRV8835 motor driver carrier (https://www.pololu.com/product/2135) with the original (v1) ct-Bot mainboard. The adapter replaces the L293D (*IC2*) and has to be plugged into its socket.
